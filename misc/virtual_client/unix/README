This directory contains various bash shell files for the automation of various tasks related to virtual clients and development. You have to create a local file defining the basepath of Quake III Arena before you are able to use the scripts. Name the file "baseq3path.local.sh" and it should at least contain the following:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

basepath="/usr/local/games/ioquake3"
arch="x86_64"
buildDir="../../../build/release-linux-$arch"
